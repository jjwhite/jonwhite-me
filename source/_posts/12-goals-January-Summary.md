Now that January is complete it's time for final update on my first goal of the year.  If you read the [initial post](/2016/01/07/12-goals-not-another-new-years-resolution/) you'll know that I'm trying somthing new with my 2016 resolutions and instead of making some generic, unmeasurable statments about improving myself, I've decided to break it down into 12 specifc goals, one for each month.  I'll be writing about my progress here.  I decided to start with a fairly simple goal for the first month - flossing.  I wanted to turn flossing into a daily habit so I wanted to floss every single day in January.  I even set up a twitter account to track the progress.

### Success or Epic Fail?

I have to say that this first goal was a roaring success.  I may have slacked off on updating the twitter feed toward the end of the month but I did not slack off on the flossing.  I can recall missing maybe 1 or 2 days during the month but I think 29 out of 31 days is pretty solid.  It's still something I have to consciously remember to do (it hasn't quite become a habit yet).  So, I'm going to have to keep it going but I'm hoping that after a few more weeks it will become engrained in my daily routine which, of course, is the ultimate goal.

### The Results

So, I've managed to keep up with flossing my teeth every day for a month.  Do I see any positive results?  How do I feel about it?  First of all, making flossing a regular habit is something I've tried countless times in the past without success.  So, this feels pretty darn good to have acheived even if it is a fairly simple thing.  Validation that this idea has got some legs for sure.  Also, I have to say that my teeth feel REALLY clean.  Now, to be fair, this could just be because I'm more conscious of how they feel because of this experiment but regardless, they do feel cleaner.  I also noticed, within the first week, that my gums were no longer bleeding after flossing which can't be a bad thing.  The real validation will be at my next dental visit when they ask that good ol' "Hows the flossing going?" question.
