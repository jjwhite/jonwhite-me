2 weeks ago I wrote <a href="/2016/01/07/12-goals-not-another-new-years-resolution/">a post</a> about how I'm taking a different approach to my new year's resolutions this year by focusing on one goal per month.  I decided to go with something fairly straight forward and attainable for the first month: daily flossing.  It's been 2 weeks since I started so it's time for an update.  So far, I've managed to keep up the routine every day but it's still something I have to consciously think about doing each night.  The hope is that by the end of the month it will be a habit that I don't have to think twice about.
