Despite the fact that my March goal did not go as well as planned, I still firmly believe in my approach of setting a single goal per month that is measurable and attainable.  One of the things I've read a lot is that making writing part of your routine can have many positive impacts.  So, for March's goal, I'd like to do some writing.  I'm going to try to write 1 well-thought out blog post per week for the entire month.  I'm not sure what these posts will be yet, but i want them to be thoughtful and well-written.
