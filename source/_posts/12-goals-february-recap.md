Well, month 2 of my 12 goals challenge for 2016 has come and gone and unfortunately I can't say I had the same success this month as I did in January.  If you recall, [the goal](2016/02/02/12-goals-February/) was to lose 5 lbs.  Well, I weighed in today and my weight is pretty much identical to what it was when I started 4 weeks ago.  

### So, What Went Wrong?

For whatever reason I just had a really tough time getting motivated for this one.  I did make an effort to hit the gym more this month but I was never able to get into a habit going.  I also had a hard time following through with the dietary restrictions I had in mind.  I also think the goal itself may have been too generic.  I may have been much better off trying something like "go to the gym 3 times a week" or "brown bag my lunch 4 days a week".  In fact, it's very likely that an upcoming goal will look very similar to one of these because although this go around did not work out as planned, I certainly am not giving up on better health!
