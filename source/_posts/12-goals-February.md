Month 1 of my 12 goals experiment is in the books and it was a [big success](/2016/01/31/12-goals-January-Summary/).  Time to make a goal for February.  I've been thinking a lot about how I should select my goals and what kinds of goals I want to achieve.  I've decided that I should consider not just setting goals that are good for me (exercise, flossing, etc.)  but also goals that are just things that I've always wanted to do but never seem to get around to it.  I have an ongoing list of both types of goals and I think I'm going to try to do 2 goals that are not necessarily fun and then 1 "fun" goal as a reward of sorts.  So, since I did a not fun goal last month I need to do 1 more before I can shoot for a fun one.

### The Goal: Lose 5 lbs.

Like most people, I've got a few extra pounds that are hanging around that I could stand to lose (I'm not an overweight person by any means but It would be nice if my jeans weren't quite as snug).  I knew that this month I wanted to do a fitness/exercise/diet goal but I wasn't too keen on doing something like "go to the gym 3 days a week" or something like that just because if felt a little too much like my last goal where I had to do something every day.  So, I decided to see if I could combine the fitness/diet goals into one.  This may turn out to be a mistake but we'll just have to see.  My goal this month is to lose 5 lbs.  That is enough in my opinion.  It should be attainable without being burdensome which is sort of the point of this whole endeavor.

I weighed myself this morning

Starting Weight: 169 lbs.
Target Weight: 164 lbs.
Stretch Goal : 160 lbs.
