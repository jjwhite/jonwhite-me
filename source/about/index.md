Generally speaking, I am a father, a husband, a programmer, a photographer, an entrepreneur, and, most importantly, a human being trying my best to enjoy my brief time on this cosmic spacecraft we call Earth.

More specifically, I am an application developer at <a href="http://mathway.com" target="_blank">Mathway</a>, part owner of <a href="http://solarsailtech.com" target="_blank">Solar Sail</a>, and I also run the macro photography blog <a href="http://thecloseupproject.com" target="_blank">The Close-Up Project</a> with professional photographer Dave Evans. Â I'm also a big fan of beer and dabble in some home-brewing from time-to-time.

This site is simply a place where i'll post about things I'm up to or that I find interesting.
