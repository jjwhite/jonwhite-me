Here are some of the things I've worked on over the years.

## Web/Mobile Development

### Web/Mobile Apps

* [Annotrak](http://annotrak.com) - A marketing tracking tool used to track the performance of online and offline campaigns.  
* [Mathway](http://mathway.com) - A web and mobile application that can solve almost any type of math problem you can think of with step-by-step solutions.
* [Digit Disorder](http://digitdisorder.com) - An Android game similar to Candy Crush except utilizing basic math equations.

### Websites

* [The Hitch Man, Inc.](http://thehitchmaninc.com)
* [Philly Kidney Docs](http://phillykidneydocs.com)

### Personal Projects
* [The Close-Up Project](http://thecloseupproject.com) - A macro photography blog I run with a friend.
* [Socks In A Box](http://games.jonwhite.me/siab) - A fun HTML canvas game I made with my daughter when she was 6 (we never really finished it)
* [Asteroids](http://games.jonwhite.me/asteroids/) - Just a fun little HTML canvas game I made (another one I wouldn't really call "finished")

## Photography

When I'm not doing development work I can usually be found with a camera in my hand.  I'm still in the process of organizing all of my photography stuff but here are a few links to check out
