I try to keep this page updated with some of the things I'm working on and enjoying right now.

### Projects

* Voice controlled basic math flash card app for Android.  This is almost done and should be in the Google Play Store soon.

### Reading

* In honor of Halloween, I'm reading the classic Bram Stoker's Dracula
* I've also been enjoying the 2012 - present run of [Hawkeye comics](http://marvel.com/comics/series/16309/hawkeye_2012_-_present)

### Watching

* Luke Cage on Netflix
* [Critical Role](http://geekandsundry.com/shows/critical-role/) - Voice actors play D&D.  It's surprisingly entertaining and makes great backround entertainment when coding.

### Playing

* Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition - I've never played before but I've been enjoying playing through a campaign with my son and some friends
* [Pillars of Eternity](https://eternity.obsidian.net/) - The D&D bug got me into some old-school RPG video gaming as well.  This game is really well done and can be quite challenging.
