I try to keep this page updated with some of the things I'm working on and enjoying right now.

### Projects

* Voice controlled basic math flash card app for Android.  This is almost done and should be in the Google Play Store soon.

### Reading

* The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman
* [Moonwalking with Einstein](https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530)
* [Wolverine: Old Man Logan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_Logan)

### Watching

* Macgyver (The original, of course, on Netflix)
* [Critical Role](http://geekandsundry.com/shows/critical-role/) - Voice actors play D&D.  It's surprisingly entertaining and makes great backround entertainment when coding.

### Playing

* Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition - I've never played before but I've been enjoying playing through a campaign with my son and some friends
* The Witcher III - One of the most impressively polished games I've ever played.
* Rocket League - Best pick-up-and-play game ever.
